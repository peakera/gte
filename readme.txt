These visuals attempt to contextualize both human characters and nonhuman others within the natural world of Mary Webb’s 1917 novel Gone to Earth. Each html file contains a force-directed graph of tags that appear within 45 characters (the average length of a sentence in the novel) of another specified tag (e.g. Hazel, Edward, Reddin). Lines connecting nodes are weighted by frequency of collocation. 

Code is based on mbostock’s block #4062045 (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) & #2706022  (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2706022)

The visualizations demonstrate that some human characters have more connections to the natural world than others and that the natural world comprises many living agents.
